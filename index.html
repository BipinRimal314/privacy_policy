<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="date">Effective date: February 18, 2026</p>

<p>Bipin Rimal ("we", "us", or "our") built Sing for the Moment (the "App") as a free, ad-supported application. This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information when you use the App.</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>

<p><strong>We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers.</strong> All data generated by the App stays on your device.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Microphone Audio:</strong> The App accesses your device microphone solely for real-time pitch detection during vocal practice sessions. Audio is processed locally on your device and is never recorded, stored, or transmitted.</li>
  <li><strong>Practice History:</strong> Session logs (exercise name, accuracy score, date) are stored locally on your device using browser localStorage. This data never leaves your device.</li>
  <li><strong>Vocal Range:</strong> Your detected vocal range is stored locally on your device for exercise transposition. It is not transmitted externally.</li>
  <li><strong>Preferences:</strong> Theme, metronome, and other settings are stored locally on your device.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Microphone Permission</h2>

<p>The App requires microphone access to detect the pitch of your voice in real time. This is the core functionality of the App. Microphone audio is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Processed in real time using the Web Audio API</li>
  <li>Never recorded to a file</li>
  <li>Never transmitted over the internet</li>
  <li>Never shared with any third party</li>
  <li>Discarded immediately after pitch analysis</li>
</ul>

<p>You may revoke microphone permission at any time through your device settings.</p>

<h2>Local Data Storage</h2>

<p>The App uses your device's localStorage to save:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Practice session history (exercise names, scores, timestamps)</li>
  <li>User preferences (theme, volume, metronome settings)</li>
  <li>Onboarding completion status</li>
  <li>Detected vocal range</li>
</ul>
<p>This data is stored entirely on your device and is never transmitted to any server. You can clear all stored data at any time through the App's Settings screen, your device settings, or by uninstalling the App.</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

<p>The App uses the following third-party services:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> We display ads through Google AdMob to support the free availability of the App. AdMob may collect device identifiers and usage data in accordance with <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a>. You can opt out of personalized ads in your device's ad settings.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

<p>The App is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. Since all data stays on-device and we collect no personal data server-side, the risk is minimal. If you are a parent and believe your child is using the App inappropriately, please contact us.</p>

<h2>Data Retention &amp; Deletion</h2>

<p>All App data is stored locally on your device. You can delete all data at any time by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Using the "Clear History" option in the App's Settings screen</li>
  <li>Clearing the App's storage in your device settings</li>
  <li>Uninstalling the App</li>
</ul>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>

<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>

<h2>Contact Us</h2>
